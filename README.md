Problem Solving:

The Netflix Dashboard project used power bi to create an interactive dashboard that analyzes and visualizes the Netflix dataset.
This dataset providing available Movies and TV Shows.
In this dataset we have 19 Rows and 6913 columns.

STEP 1:
We need to analyzes the datasets row and columns .
And remove the empty rows ,columns and unwanted details.
Now, we have 6900 datasets.

STEP 2:

Modify the dataset using Condition Formatting ,New Measure and New Column by DAX Function.
Using Condition Formatting i have elaborate the certificates names ,year ,types and etc.
In this dataset we have only 2 types of categories.
                               1. MOVIES
                               2. TV SHOWS

STEP 3:
Using Measure tools we can able to create single values in datasets and i have used the measure tools to calculate total number of movies and TV shows.
Using columns tools we can able to create multiple values in datasets and i have used IF Condition in the  columns tools to separate the movies and TV shows from the datasets.

STEP 4:
CHARTS:-
I have used Cards ,Slicer ,Pie Charts ,Map and etc

CARDS: These are visualizations that display single values or metrics.
SLICER: These are visualizations that allow you to filter other visuals on the report page based on your selection.
PIE & DONUT CHART: These are charts that display data using circular segments. They are useful for showing proportions or percentages.
MAP: These are visualizations that display data using geographical locations.
TABLES: These are visualizations that display data using rows and columns. They are useful for showing detailed.
BAR CHART: These are charts that display data using vertical or horizontal bars. They are useful for comparing values across categories.
FUNNEL: helps you visualize a linear process that has sequential, connected stages.
